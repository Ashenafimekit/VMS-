# Vehicle Management Dashboard

A simple, interactive vehicle management dashboard built with React.js for the frontend, and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend. This application allows users to manage vehicle data efficiently by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing vehicle information in a flexible table format.

## Features

- **Vehicle Table Display**: Displays vehicle data (name, number, status, and last updated time) fetched from MongoDB in a sortable, filterable, and searchable table.
- **Add New Vehicle**: Adds a new vehicle with a unique vehicle number and sets the "Last Updated" column to "No Update" initially. The table updates immediately after submission.
- **Edit Vehicle**: Each vehicle in the table has an edit button that allows the user to modify its name, number, and status. The "Last Updated" column reflects the current time and date after any edit.
- **Delete Vehicle**: A delete button next to each vehicle allows users to remove vehicles from the table, with immediate updates after deletion.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- MongoDB (or MongoDB Atlas for cloud database)

Certainly! Since you've pushed the `frontend` and `backend` in different branches, the installation setup will need to reflect that. Here's how you can update the installation instructions to guide users through cloning the repository and checking out the respective branches for frontend and backend.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- MongoDB (or MongoDB Atlas for cloud database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashenafimekit/VMS-.git
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**:
   - Navigate to the backend branch:

     ```bash
     git checkout backend
     ```

   - Install the backend dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```

   - Set up your MongoDB database. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, create a cluster and get your connection string. Update the connection string in `backend/config/db.js`.

   - Start the backend server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Set up the frontend**:
   - Navigate to the frontend branch:

     ```bash
     git checkout frontend
     ```

   - Install the frontend dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the frontend server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

4. **Open the dashboard**:
   Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the vehicle management dashboard.

### Summary of Steps:
- Clone the repository and check out the appropriate branches for frontend and backend (`git checkout frontend` and `git checkout backend`).
- Install dependencies for both frontend and backend, then run them.

## Usage

### Displaying Vehicles

The vehicles are fetched from MongoDB and displayed in a table. You can search, sort, and filter the table to easily manage the vehicle list.

### Adding a Vehicle

Click the "Add Vehicle" button to open a modal. Enter the vehicle's name, number, and status. The vehicle number must be unique. After submission, the table is updated with the new vehicle and the "Last Updated" column is set to "No Update."

### Editing a Vehicle

Each row in the table has an "Edit" button. Clicking this button opens a modal with the vehicleâ€™s data. You can modify the vehicle details and save the changes, which will update the "Last Updated" column with the current time and date.

### Deleting a Vehicle

Each row also has a "Delete" button. Clicking the button will remove the vehicle from the database, and the table will update immediately.
